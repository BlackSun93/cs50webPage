# Project 0

Hello, this is my website, it consists of 4 html pages and a scss file.

in stylesh.scss are some global styles these include: the text colour
the @media queries to define how the pages should behave on certain sized screens
the background colour for the pages
the font to be used inside of <divs> and the margin spacing for paragraphs within divs. 
formatting of table headers and table data fields
Behaviour of the navigation bar (ID #navigation)
How any div with the firstdiv class should behave (to space out the text from the top of the page)
how the #joblist should behave (this had to be in the scss file as it has nested elements as I wanted to define specific behaviour for lists inside the joblist)
The bahaviour of all images as well as 2 extensions of this formatting.

title.html explains briefly what is on the other pages and supplies links to them.
travelling.html consists of some pictures from my travels, formatted using bootstraps's columns and using @media queries to define behaviour depending on the screen size.
career.html explains a bit about other jobs I have done (calling it a career is a bit of a stretch!) this uses an unordered list and a differently formtted interior list.
vehicles.html explains a bit about one of my interests, it has differently formatted pictures from the travellling page as well as a table.
all of these pages use the navigation component from bootstrap.
