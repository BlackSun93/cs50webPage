        <div class="firstDiv">
        I have ended up doing this web development course partially because of the current coronavirus situation meaning that i am off work for the forseeable future, 
        but also because i am a computer science student at Anglia ruskin university in Cambridge. I have finished by first year as a computer science student and need the motivation
        to keep learning related skills over the summer.
    </div>

       Here are some of my past jobs and qualifications:
       <ul id="jobList">
        <li>housing benefits officer</li>  
        <ul>
            <li>This was a challenging, office based job however I was 18 and was not ready to live the office life</li>
            <li>eye opening insight into people's lives</li>
        </ul>
         <li>cleaner</li> 
         <li>warehouse operative</li> 
         <li>apricot picker</li> 
         <li>grain shed operator</li> 
          <ul>
            <li>Very interesting job, you have to spend 3 months working in the outback and I spent my 3 months here, went back the year after</li>
            <li>Surprisingly well paid, can't guarantee I'd be typing this if they accepted foreigners full time</li>
          </ul>
         <li>forklift driver</li>
          <ul>
           <li>I enjoy operating forklifts, a bit of a learning curve but I really got into the swing of it before they closed the factory down</li>
           <li>My friend's freezer was stocked with garlic bread for months after I left</li>
          </ul>
         <li>grain shed operator round 2</li> 
         <li>solar farm labourer</li> 
         <li>tree nursery labourer</li> 
         <li>and finally a warehouse operative again</li> 
        </ul>
       
        I have been trying to teach myself computer science related skills for a few years now and after returning home from australia I applied and was accepted into university
        As you can see most of my resume involves labourious jobs, so I am not afraid to get my hands dirty! however none of those lead to careers that i find satisfying, or ultimatley,
        well paying enough. I think i have a good aptitide for using computers so I hope to be able to make a proper go of it.
